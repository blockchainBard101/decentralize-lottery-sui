# 🎰 Decentralized Lottery dApp on Sui

A decentralized, on-chain lottery application built using React, Sui Move smart contracts, and the Suiet Wallet Kit.

Tickets are minted as NFTs, and prizes are distributed programmatically once a winner is determined.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎟️ Buy lottery tickets using SUI
- 🧠 Determine lottery winner on-chain
- 💰 Withdraw prize and commission funds
- 🛠️ React frontend integrated with Suiet Wallet
- 🔗 On-chain events synced to backend via REST API
- 🧾 NFTs as tickets for verifiability and traceability
